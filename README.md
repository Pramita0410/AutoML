# AutoML using H2O

In this assignment, I used an AutoML library i.e., H2O.ai to create predictive models and interpret them. 

Found a significant relation for each algorithm of the choosing in the data.

Created multivariate models.

Found the answers of the following questions for all of the models:

* Is the relationship significant?

* Are any model assumptions violated?

* Is there any multicollinearity in the model?

* In the multivariate models are predictor variables independent of all the other predictor variables?

* In in multivariate models rank the most significant predictor variables and exclude insignificant ones from the model.

* Does the model make sense?

* Does regularization help?

* Which independent variables are significant?

* Which hyperparameters are important?
